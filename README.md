(!! Clarification of Potential Misunderstanding !!)
- Sean and Bharat have worked together on the Visual Studio Code's LiveShare, which is a tool platform that lets multiple individuals work together on the same code simulataneously. 
    Therefore, most of the commits of Bharat's git is a reflection of both Bharat AND Sean's work. Please consider this when evaluating the contributions.
