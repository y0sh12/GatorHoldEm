# GatorHoldEm

Github repo: https://github.com/y0sh12/GatorHoldEm

Description:
GatorHoldEm is a desktop poker application which allows users to play one another or with an Artificial Intelligence robot. In order to play, users just have to open the application and play on a room of their choice. The first person to join a room becomes the 'VIP' and has the ability to add and remove players and AI bots as well as start the game. In order to start the game, you must have atleast two people in the room (including AI bots) and a maximum of 6 people. Once in the game, use the start game button to start the game. At the end of the game you will be returned to the main menu. 

Installation: 
1. Use `pip install GatorHoldEm` to install the library dependencies
2. Run the command `gatorholdem` to run the client*.
3. The server can be run locally in a different window by running the SocketIOServer.py file 
   using 'python3 SocketIOServer.py' 

    *If using WSL, you will need an X server to support graphical display
